OVERFITTING:- Learning too much from training data compared to testing data
UNDERFITTING:- Learning too low from training data compared to testing data

REGULARISATION:- This set restriction/penalty on training and testing data

Types (Stricter Linear Regression):-
1. Ridge Regression - will try to make the co-efficients 0 but will never make them 0.
2. Lasso Regression - will make the co-efficients 0.

They reduce the co-efficients of 'X's to near 0 so that their effect on the equation become less. 

Ridge will try to make the co-efficients 0 but will never make them 0.
Lasso will make the co-efficients 0.
