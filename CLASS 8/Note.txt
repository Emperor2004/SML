Using both MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler together is sometimes required because they serve different purposes, and combining them can improve the performance of machine learning models in certain cases.

Why Use Both?
Handling Different Feature Distributions

MinMaxScaler scales features to a fixed range [0,1] or [−1,1], which is useful when features have different dynamic ranges.
StandardScaler standardizes features to have zero mean and unit variance (𝜇=0,𝜎=1), which is useful when data follows a normal distribution.
When features have different types of distributions, applying both scalers can ensure better transformation.

Improving Model Convergence

Some machine learning algorithms (like neural networks) perform better with normalized input (MinMax) and standardized features (StandardScaler).
Applying MinMaxScaler first followed by StandardScaler ensures that data is well-conditioned for gradient-based optimizations.

Avoiding Outlier Influence

MinMaxScaler is sensitive to outliers because it maps everything between a fixed range based on the min and max values.
StandardScaler reduces outlier influence by transforming data based on standard deviation.
Combining both can balance between normalization and robustness to outliers.
