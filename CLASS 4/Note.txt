MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

VIF - Variance Inflation Factor - It only works with 'x'- How the change in one independent variable affect other independent variable

Y = B0 + B1x1 + B2x2 + ... + e

B0 = y-intercept
B1, B2 ... = Slopes
e = model error

VIF starts at 1 and has no upper limit
VIF exceeding 5 indicate high multicolinearlity

VIF = 1/(1-(Ri)^2)
